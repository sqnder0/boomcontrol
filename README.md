# 💥 BoomControl

**BoomControl** is a lightweight and focused plugin designed specifically for **SMP servers** that want to **limit or nerf Crystal PvP**. It offers fine-tuned control over End Crystal and Respawn Anchor explosions to prevent unfair advantages or griefing, while keeping gameplay fun and balanced.

## 🎯 Why BoomControl?

On many SMPs, End Crystals and Respawn Anchors are used in PvP for massive burst damage. BoomControl gives you **full control** over how these items behave:

*   Disable or weaken crystal PvP
*   Prevent griefing through explosion block damage
*   Make explosions only damage the attacker
*   Keep your SMP fun and fair without banning crystals entirely

## 📝 Test it out\!  
You can test BoomControl on Minehut \(Java only\)\!  
Add a new server, choose a name you like, and use the following IP\:
```
minehut.com
```
Once connected to Minehut, join the test server by running\:
```
/join devbc
```
This will start the test server\. Happy testing!

## 🧨 Crystal Settings

```
crystal:
  enabled: true           # REQUIRES server restart to change
  mode: "self"            # Options: "disabled", "self", "vanilla"
  break-blocks: false     # Prevents block damage
  start-fire: false       # Stops fire on explosion
  show-deny-message: true # Inform players when blocked
```

### Modes:

*   `"disabled"` – Crystals won't explode at all.
*   `"self"` – Only the player who triggered the explosion takes damage.
*   `"vanilla"` – Default Minecraft behavior.

## 🌋 Respawn Anchor Settings

```
anchor:
  enabled: true
  mode: "self"            # Same options as crystal
  break-blocks: true
  start-fire: true
  show-deny-message: true
```

Perfect for controlling Nether-based PvP or creative mechanics using anchors.

- - -

## 🔄 Command

```
/boomcontrol reload
```

Reloads the plugin configuration **without restarting the server**.  
⚠️ Note: The `enabled` toggle and `crystal.enabled` **require a restart**.

- - -

## 🗨️ Custom Messages

```
messages:
  crystal-denied: "&cCrystal PvP is disabled on this server."
  anchor-denied: "&cRespawn anchor damage is not allowed."
```

Use color codes (`&c`, `&7`, etc.) to style your messages.

## 🛑 World Blacklist

BoomControl now supports **disabling the plugin entirely in specific worlds** via a blacklist configured in `settings.yml`. This is useful if you want BoomControl to be completely inactive in certain worlds (like the Nether, End, or lobby worlds), regardless of region flags or other settings.

### Example configuration:

```yaml
blacklisted_worlds:
- world_nether
- world_the_end
  ```

### How it works:

- If a world is listed in `blacklisted_worlds`, BoomControl will be **fully disabled in that world**.
- This means that any region-based controls or WorldGuard flags are ignored for that world.
- Vanilla Minecraft explosion behavior applies in those worlds instead.

### Usage tips:

- Leave the list empty to enable BoomControl in *all* worlds.
- Add worlds where you want BoomControl disabled completely, such as lobby or event worlds.
- Combine this blacklist with WorldGuard region flags to achieve fine-grained control elsewhere.

## 🏳️ WorldGuard Integration (Optional)

BoomControl integrates with [WorldGuard](https://enginehub.org/worldguard/) to support **region-based control** using a custom flag.

### 🔖 `boomcontrol` Flag

If WorldGuard is installed, BoomControl registers a custom region flag:

```
boomcontrol
```

This flag allows you to **disable BoomControl in specific regions**, even if the plugin is globally enabled.

### 🧰 How It Works

- If the flag is set to `DENY` in a region, **BoomControl will be disabled there completely**.  
  Explosion behavior in that region will follow normal Minecraft mechanics.
- If the flag is **not set** or explicitly `ALLOW`, BoomControl will apply as configured in `settings.yml`.

### 🧪 Example

To disable BoomControl inside a region:

```bash
/rg flag spawn boomcontrol deny
```

To enable it again:

```bash
/rg flag spawn boomcontrol allow
```

To remove the flag entirely:

```bash
/rg flag spawn -r boomcontrol
```

### ❗ Default Behavior

- If the flag is **not set**, BoomControl assumes `ALLOW`.
- This means BoomControl is **active everywhere** by default, unless explicitly denied via region flag.
